Veracode Static for Visual Studio is an extension for Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and 2022. You use the extension to assist with compiling your applications and uploading them to Veracode for [Static Analysis](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_static_overview). 

The extension enables you to identify and work with security findings in your application, go to the line of code that contains findings, view datapath information, and get remediation guidance from within the IDE.
