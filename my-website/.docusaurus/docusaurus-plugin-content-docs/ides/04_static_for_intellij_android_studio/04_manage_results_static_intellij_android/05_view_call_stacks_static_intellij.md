You can view call stacks for findings in from within your IDE.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

You have [imported the scan results](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Download_Veracode_Results_for_IntelliJ_Using_the_Veracode_Platform).

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  In your IDE, select a finding in the Results view.

2.  Right-click the row you selected and, then, select **Show Call Stacks** to download the call stacks for that finding.

3.  In the Call Stacks view, double-click the finding to open the source file.

4.  Scroll the window to highlight the location of the finding within the source file. If the source file does not open, because it is not referenced in a project that is part of the current workspace, you can add references to that file.
