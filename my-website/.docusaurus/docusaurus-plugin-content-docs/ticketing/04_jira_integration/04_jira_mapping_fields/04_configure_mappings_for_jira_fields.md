You can configure mappings between custom fields in the Veracode Platform and fields in Jira. The Veracode Integration for Jira uses these mappings to import specific information when importing findings as Jira issues.

1. In Jira, select **Administration** > **Manage apps** > **Field Mappings**.

2. In the Veracode Platform column, click the dropdown menu and select the name of the Veracode field you want to map. For example, **Application Name**.

3. In the Jira column, from the dropdown menu, select the Jira field you want to map to the Veracode field.

4. Click **Add Mapping**.

5. Repeat these steps until you have mapped all the desired fields.
