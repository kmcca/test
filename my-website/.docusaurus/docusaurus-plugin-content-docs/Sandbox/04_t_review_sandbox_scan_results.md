You can access the results from sandbox scans to review the findings.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

If you have the Creator, Submitter, Reviewer, Security Lead, or Sandbox Administrator [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions), you can view sandboxes.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

[Flaw matching](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_review_matchflaws) occurs when you perform two scans of the same application. Veracode compares the results of the second scan to the first scan to identify any findings that might be identical between the two scans.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  From your application left navigation menu, click **Sandbox Scans**.

2.  Click the name of the desired scan to go to the scan overview page of that scan.
