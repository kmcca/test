If you created a gateway in error or have stopped using it, you can delete it from your ISM configuration.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

Before you can delete a gateway, you must [delete the endpoints connected to it](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_delete_endpoint).

If you allowed the gateway IP address, Veracode recommends that you remove it from your network allowlist before deleting the gateway.
