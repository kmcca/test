You can view the availability status of Veracode services to understand if there are any outages that may impact your ability to access the Veracode Platform and other Veracode sites.

To check the status of a Veracode site, go to [http://status.veracode.com/](http://status.veracode.com/). If Veracode experiences a disruption or degradation in service, Veracode posts an announcement on the status page.

The Veracode status page shows a banner describing the overall status of Veracode services, followed by a list of Veracode services that shows the 90-day performance history of each service. Days in which there was a service degradation appear yellow or red. You can hover over specific days for details of the incidents.

If there is an incident or scheduled maintenance, Veracode posts a notice, with details about the incident, on the status page. For incidents and scheduled maintenance, Veracode provides a status indicator and a message that explains the disruption and highlights the affected services.
