The Veracode Platform provides four reports that provide consumption data associated with your Veracode licenses: the License Used Report, Largest Scan Report, the All Scans Report, and the License Used Tier Model report. These reports track scan activity that uses your licenses for Veracode Static Analysis and Dynamic Analysis.
