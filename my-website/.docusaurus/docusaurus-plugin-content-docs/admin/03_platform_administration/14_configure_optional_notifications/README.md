Using the notification settings of your Veracode Platform account, you can subscribe to or unsubscribe from specific notifications based on scan type and policy event.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

By default, you receive all scan status notifications relevant to your role and team membership, but you do not receive notifications about policy events.

If you have the Administrator [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions), you can [turn off all optional notifications for your organization by default](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_admin_disable_notifications).

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  Select **Notification Settings** from the bell menu ![notifications icon](../../images/bell_icon.png).

2.  In the Scan Status section, click the **Email** switch to turn off scan status emails for a specific scan type.

3.  If you have notifications for static sandbox scans enabled, choose to receive notifications about all sandboxes or only the sandboxes you created.

4.  In the Static Policy section, click the **Email** switch to turn on emails for specific events that impact your policies.
