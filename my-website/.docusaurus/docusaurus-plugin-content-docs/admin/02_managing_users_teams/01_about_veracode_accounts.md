Veracode provides two account types: a user account, for real human users, and an API service account, for non-human users.

-   A user account can access the Veracode Platform and the Veracode APIs. Account permissions are based on the [user roles](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions) or [API roles](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_API_roles) assigned to the account.
-   An API service account is for non-human users, such as systems or services, that need to access the Veracode APIs. Veracode recommends that you use this account for automations. For example, you could use this account with the APIs to automate an application analysis that runs unattended and without disruption if a user account expires or becomes disabled. Account permissions are based on the [API roles](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_API_roles) assigned to the account.

You can create and manage both account types in the [Veracode Platform](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_manage_user) and with the [Veracode Identity APIs](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_identity_intro).
