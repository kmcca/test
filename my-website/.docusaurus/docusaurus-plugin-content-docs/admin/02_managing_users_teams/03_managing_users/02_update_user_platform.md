You can update an account for an existing user. The account type can be a user account or API service account.

You can also update a user with the [Veracode Identity APIs](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_identity_update_user).

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  In the **Users** tab on the Administration page, select the user you want to manage.

    To find a user you can filter the list of users by one of the filter options provided, or search for the user's first or last name using the Search field.

2.  Click the username or **Edit** to open the user for editing.

3.  Make the changes to the user as needed.

4.  Click **Save**.

If you change the email address of the user, Veracode sends an email to the new address to [verify it](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Request_User_Email_Verification). The change cannot complete until the user performs the verification. If the user had previously used their email address to log in to the Veracode Platform, they must use the new verified address.
