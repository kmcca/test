The scan capacity subscription you purchase from Veracode determines the concurrent scan capacity at which you can perform Dynamic Analysis scans.

Your scan capacity is indicated on the Dynamic Analysis Scans summary page.

After you configure and submit your Dynamic Analysis scans, the availability of scan engines determines if scans of the URL configurations run concurrently or if they are queued until capacity becomes available. You can [review the status](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_was_statuses) of your scans in the Status column in the All Dynamic Analysis Scans table.
