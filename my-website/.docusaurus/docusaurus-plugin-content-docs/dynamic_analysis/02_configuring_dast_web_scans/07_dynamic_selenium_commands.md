This table lists the Selenium commands Veracode supports in sequence scripts. You can upload scripts to a Dynamic Analysis. Your Selenium IDE version might not support all these commands.

For further information about these commands, see the [Selenium documentation](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/docs/en/api/commands).

| `assertAlert`, `assertPrompt`, or `assertConfirmation`                                   | These commands have identical implementations. They switch focus to the current alert box on the page and determine if the user-provided text matches the alert text. If it does not match or there is no alert box on the page, these commands fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If you cannot locate the targeted element within that amount of time, the command times out and fails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `assertTextPresent` or `verifyTextPresent`                                               | Veracode checks the provided text against the HTML source of the currently rendered page, not the original source. Therefore, HTML elements you add to the page through JavaScript can be matched with this command only if the JavaScript code mutating the DOM finishes executing before this command is executed. This command requires the scan engine to fully serialize the page currently loaded in the browser. It can be extremely time-consuming for complex pages.          |

Therefore, HTML elements you add to the page through JavaScript can be matched with this command only if the JavaScript code mutating the DOM finishes executing before you execute the command. This command requires the scan engine to fully serialize the page currently loaded in the browser. This process can be extremely time-consuming for complex pages. |
| `waitForElementToLoad`, `waitForTitle`, `waitForTextPresent`, or `waitForElementPresent` | You can provide an optional timeout value in the `value` element of these Selenium IDE commands.
