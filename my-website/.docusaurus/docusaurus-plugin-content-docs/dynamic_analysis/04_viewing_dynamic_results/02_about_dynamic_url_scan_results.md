You must have the Creator, Reviewer, or Security Lead [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions) to be able to view the results of a Dynamic Analysis, unless the results are [linked to an application](https://docs.veracode.com/r/About_Dynamic_Analysis_Application_Linking) that you have permission to view.

1. In the Veracode Platform, select **Scans & Analysis** \> **Dynamic Analysis**.
