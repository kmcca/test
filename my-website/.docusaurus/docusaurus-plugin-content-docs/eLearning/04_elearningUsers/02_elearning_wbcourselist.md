If you are a learner, you can view your progress in eLearning training.

You can access, start, pause, and restart Veracode eLearning online courses. Veracode does not limit the number of times you can take a course.

1.  Go to **eLearning** \> **My Courses**.

    <p style="background-color:#FFFCF3; padding: 12px; border-left: 5px solid #F7CD55;"><b>Note:</b> If you do not have the eLearning menu item, your organization may not have purchased eLearning, or your account may not be configured as a learner account. Contact Veracode to access the eLearning features.</p>

2.  On the **My Courses** page, you can browse these tabs:

    -   To-Do: to view a list of courses with a status of in-progress or failed, or that are required by your company.
    -   Completed: to view a list of the courses you have finished.
    -   All Courses: to view a list of all courses available for you to take.
    If you have a course assignment that is in more than one curricula, the My Courses page shows the information for the course that is due first.

3.  To start a course, click the play icon ![](../images/play_icon.png).

    When you click the play icon ![](../images/play_icon.png), you use one of the seat assignments in your organization [eLearning subscription](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_view_elearning_license).

4.  The Veracode Platform keeps track of your progress through a course. To pause a course, click the pause button in the controls section at the bottom of the course browser window. To leave or exit a course, click **Close**.
5.  To resume a previously-started course, click the play icon ![](../images/play_icon.png) again. As the course is starting, the Veracode Platform prompts you to continue the course from where you last accessed it, or start the course from the beginning.
