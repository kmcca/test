As you complete assigned courses, you achieve the Veracode learner levels.

Learner levels are tiered categories of Veracode eLearning courses that align with the [Veracode Verified](https://community.veracode.com/s/get-verified) program. The Veracode Verified program helps your company prove their secure software development practices. After completing each level, you can download a certificate of your completed courses. You can select from three available learner levels:

-   Level 1: Developer Security Fundamentals
-   Level 2: Verified Team Security Champion
-   Level 3: Verified Continuous Security Champion

You can take Veracode eLearning courses in any order, regardless of the learner level. However, you must complete all required courses to [complete the level](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_complete_learner_level) and download the certificate. You can only achieve a certificate for a level if you have already completed the previous level. For example, before you can achieve a level 2 certificate, you must have already completed all courses in level 1.

Veracode adds new courses and revises existing courses as needed. If you complete a learner level and Veracode then adds a new course to that level, eLearning no longer shows that learner level as complete. You must complete that new course to achieve that learner level certificate.
