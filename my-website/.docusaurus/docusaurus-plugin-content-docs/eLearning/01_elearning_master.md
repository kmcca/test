Veracode eLearning consists of course-based training that helps developers gain the critical skills they need to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

Veracode eLearning includes:

-   [Online courses](https://docs.veracode.com/r/elearning_wbcourselist) to improve security knowledge
-   [Knowledge Base](https://docs.veracode.com/r/elearning_aboutkb) on secure software development

The Veracode Platform provides online training modules for developers, managers, and security personnel that are integrated directly into the Veracode Platform. These courses enable organizations to meet formal security training and competency testing requirements. The Veracode Platform enables organizations to continuously improve their skills through targeted online courses and a security knowledge base. As a learner, you can take courses at your own pace. The Veracode Platform provides dashboards and [usage-metric reports](https://docs.veracode.com/r/elearning_manager) that document the courses you have completed and the competency testing results.

As a learner, when you complete coursework, you are eligible for continuing professional education \(CPE\) credits as part of International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium, Inc. \(ISC\)Â², Certified Information Systems Security Professional \(CISSP\), and Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional \(CSSLP\) certifications. Implementing formal secure development training programs can help organizations comply with ISO regulations and new industry standards such as the SANS Application Security Procurement Contract Language, which many companies use as a requirement for vendors to supply custom software.
