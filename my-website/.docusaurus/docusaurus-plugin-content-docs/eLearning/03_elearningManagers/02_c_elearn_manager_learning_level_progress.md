You can view the progress of your learners as they take eLearning courses.

The **My Learners** tab identifies the required or optional courses and learner levels achieved by all the learners you manage. If you are an eLearning manager, you can view progress only for your learners. If you have the Executive role, you can view all learners in your organization.
