Veracode eLearning administrators can view eLearning subscriptions and manage learners, eLearning managers, and course curricula.

An eLearning administrator is a user who has both the Administrator and eLearning [roles](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions).

A Veracode administrator can:

-   [Create new users](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_create_users)
-   [Update existing users](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_manage_user) to be learners, executives, and eLearning administrators

A Veracode eLearning administrator can:

-   [View subscription details](03_t_view_elearning_license.md)
-   [Manage curricula](11_managing_curricula/README.md)
-   [Assign course tracks to learners](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_assigning_course_tracks)
-   [Auto-extend](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_about_auto_extend) eLearning seats to learners
-   Create or modify [eLearning manager assignments](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_manage_elearning_managers)

eLearning administrators can assign learner settings for either:

[Multiple learners](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_assign_track_bulk):   You can apply curricula, tracks, auto-extend, and manager assignments to many users at one time.

[An individual learner](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Modify_Individual_Learner_Settings):   If you have a new learner, you can assign settings from one page. You can also modify existing settings for any individual learner.
