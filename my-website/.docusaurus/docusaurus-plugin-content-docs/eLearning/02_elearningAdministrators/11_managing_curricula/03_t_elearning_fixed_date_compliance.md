You can create a new curriculum with a compliance reset date that requires learners to retake courses on a regular cadence.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

Only Veracode eLearning administrators can create curricula. You must have the [Administrator and eLearning roles](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions) to create a curriculum.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

You can create a repeatable curriculum based on a compliance period. For example, your organization may require learners to repeat specific courses on a regular cadence to meet compliance requirements. By setting a compliance reset date, you force the required curriculum to restart for the learners after a specified duration.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  From the gear icon ![](../../images/gear_icon.png) at the top of the Veracode Platform page, go to **Admin** \> **eLearning** \> **Settings and Curricula**.

2.  Click **Add New Curriculum**.

    The Add Curriculum page opens.

3.  Enter a name in the Curriculum Name field.

4.  From the Track dropdown menu, select a Veracode eLearning track.

    A page opens with a table of all courses included in the selected track.

5.  From the Due Date dropdown menu, select **Fixed**.

6.  Click the calendar icon ![](../../calendar.png) to open a calendar and select a fixed date.

    <p style="background-color:#FFFCF3; padding: 12px; border-left: 5px solid #F7CD55;"><b>Note:</b> The due date applies to required courses only.</p>

7.  In the Compliance Reset Period section, define the duration of the compliance reset period, starting on a specific date:

    a.  Select **Every**.

    b.  Enter the number of months for the duration of the period.

    c.  Click the calendar icon ![](../../calendar.png) to open a calendar and, then, select a date.

    When the compliance period ends, the new start date and due date reset automatically.

8.  Select courses to include in the curriculum:

    -   To select one course at a time, select the checkbox next to a course name.
    -   To select all courses in a track, select the **Course Name** checkbox in the table heading.

9.  Optionally, make the selected courses required for learners:

    -   To make a single course required, select the **Required** checkbox next to a course name.
    -   To make all selected courses required, select the **Required** checkbox in the table heading.

    If you do not make a course required, the course is optional.

10. Click **OK**.
