As a Veracode eLearning administrator, you can create curricula for learners.

You create and manage curricula, which are course containers that consist of one or more courses from a specific track. When designing a curriculum, you need to consider:

-   Which courses are required or optional.
-   For every required course, the due date when the learners must complete the course.
-   For required courses, a [compliance reset date](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_elearning_fixed_date_compliance) when the learners must repeat the courses.

A course can be in more than one curricula.

You can [enroll one or more learners in the curriculum](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_assign_curriculum). After you enroll learners, the courses become available and Veracode eLearning managers and learners can access the courses in that curriculum.

Veracode eLearning provides four types of curricula:

-   Curriculum without a due date.
-   Curriculum with a fixed due date.
-   Curriculum with a fixed due date and compliance reset date: when the compliance period ends, the new start date and due date reset automatically.
-   Curriculum with a relative due date: you specify a date when learners must complete all required courses successfully with a passing grade. The due date is relative to the time when you add the learner to the curriculum.

When you create or edit a curriculum, you can specify whether individual courses are required or optional.

After creating a curriculum, you can [assign a learner to that curriculum](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_assign_curriculum). You can assign a learner to multiple curricula.
