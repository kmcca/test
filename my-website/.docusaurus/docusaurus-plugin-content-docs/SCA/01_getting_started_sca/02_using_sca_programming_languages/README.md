Veracode Software Composition Analysis features are available for several programming languages, which all have specific requirements for performing scans.

For the detailed list of supported tools and languages, see [About Supported Languages and Tools for Agent-Based Scans](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_sc_supported_lang) and [Understanding Language Support for Veracode SCA Upload Scans](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_sca_upload_support).

**Java**

To assess the security risk of open-source components in your Java code early and frequently in your development, perform [agent-based scans on the command line or as an automated step in your pipeline](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_sc_java). Plugins are available to automate scanning of [Gradle](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_sc_gradle) or [Maven](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_sc_maven) repositories for Java applications. Sample Java repositories are available [in GitHub](https://github.com/srcclr?language=java) to demonstrate how to run agent-based scans.

To analyze the open-source risk of your compiled Java application as part of a Veracode Static Analysis, upload your application binaries to Veracode. Your application must meet the [Java packaging requirements](https://docs.veracode.com/r/compilation_java). See [Requesting a Veracode SCA Upload Scan](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_sca_standalone_upload) and [Reviewing Your Application Portfolio with Veracode SCA](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Reviewing_Your_Application_Portfolio_with_Veracode_SCA).
