Setting up Veracode Software Composition Analysis agent-based scanning for your desktop allows you to view open-source vulnerability and component information for your personal repositories in one central location.

The agent-based scanning command-line interface \(CLI\) allows the scanning of both your local file system and of repositories located in a source code management system. The agent-based scanning CLI allows highly configurable and scriptable usage.

If you encounter issues with agent-based scanning in your pipeline, you can use the command-line agent to run scans locally for troubleshooting purposes.

-   Veracode SCA agent for building, scanning, and sending evidence from repositories to the platform. For full list of requirements for the agent, see [Using the Veracode SCA Agent](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_sc_agent_usage).
-   The correct requirements depend on the scanned language. To see what those requirements are, select the programming language in [About Supported Languages and Tools for Agent-Based Scans](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_sc_supported_lang).
