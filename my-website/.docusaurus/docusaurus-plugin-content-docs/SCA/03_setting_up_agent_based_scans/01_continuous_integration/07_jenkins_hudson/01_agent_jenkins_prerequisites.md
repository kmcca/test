To integrate Veracode Software Composition Analysis with Jenkins in a secure manner, you need to download the [Credentials Binding Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding/) for binding your API token to the environment variable for the Veracode SCA API token.

Depending on the build and package managers your repositories use, your agent needs the correct requirements for the scanned language. To see what those requirements are, select the code language in [About Supported Languages and Tools for Agent-Based Scans](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_sc_supported_lang).
