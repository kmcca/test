Workspaces help you organize your project data for Veracode Software Composition Analysis agent-based scanning. Use workspaces to organize scan results by application or business unit.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

You have the Security Lead or Creator [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions).

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

Workspaces are similar to teams. Scan results are available at the project level, and projects are available at the workspace level. You can also customize your workspace to suit your needs.

[My Workspace](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Using_My_Workspace_for_Veracode_SCA), which is available for all users, provides limited functionality for experimenting with agent-based scans.

You can also perform this task with the [SCA Agent REST API](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_sourceclear_intro). 

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  In the Veracode Platform, select **Scans & Analysis** > **Software Composition Analysis**.

2.  Click the **Agent-Based Scan** tab.

3.  Select **Actions** > **Create Workspace**.

4.  Enter a name for the workspace.

5.  If you want to add [teams](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Using_Teams_with_Veracode_SCA) to the workspace, click **More Options** and select one or more teams.

6.  Click **Create**.

[Invite team members](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Add_Teams_to_Your_Veracode_SCA_Workspace) to your workspace to give them access to scan results and [create an agent](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Create_Veracode_SCA_Agents).
