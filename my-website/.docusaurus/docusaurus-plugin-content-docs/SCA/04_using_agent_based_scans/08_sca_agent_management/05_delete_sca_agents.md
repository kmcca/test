For information on deleting agents with the SCA Agent REST API, see [Using the Veracode SCA Agent REST API](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_sourceclear_intro).

To delete an organization-level agent, you must have the Security Lead [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions).

To delete a workspace agent, you must have the Security Lead, Workspace Administrator, Workspace Editor, or Submitter role.
