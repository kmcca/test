You can find vulnerabilities in your Kotlin repositories using Veracode Software Composition Analysis agent-based scanning. You can run agent-based scans of Maven and Gradle repositories using the [agent-based scanning command-line interface](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_sc_agent_usage) or the [CI integrations](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Integrate_Veracode_SCA_Agent_Based_Scanning_with_Your_CI_Projects).

The requirements for running a scan and reviewing results for Kotlin repositories are the same as the [requirements for Java repositories](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_sc_java).

For packaging instructions for Veracode Static Analysis and Veracode SCA upload scans, see [Packaging Kotlin Applications](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_compilation_kotlin).
