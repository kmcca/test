If you and your vendor both have subscriptions to [Software Composition Analysis \(SCA\)](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_integrated_benefits), when the vendor shares a report with you, a link to the SCA report for the scanned application is also included in the Shared Reports list.

Clicking the **SCA Report** link opens the report on the Software Composition Analysis page.
