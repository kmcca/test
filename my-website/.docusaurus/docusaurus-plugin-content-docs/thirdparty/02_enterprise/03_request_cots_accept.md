If a Veracode customer requests an assessment of your code through the third-party scan process, you must first review the request. Ensure that you can provide the code requested before uploading code for static analysis and providing information for Dynamic Analysis.

Before you can review third-party scan requests, you must:

-   Have [requested a third-party application scan](01_request_profile_cots.md)
-   Have the Creator, Submitter, or Security Lead [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions) to create and upload files for a scan
-   Have the Security Lead role or be a member of the [team](https://docs.veracode.com/r/admin_team) associated with the application to accept a third-party scan request

If you do not have these roles, contact Veracode Technical Support.

##Locate the Third-Party Scan Request

When you log into the Veracode Platform, go to **My Portfolio > Applications**. The requested application is in your applications list with a status of Agreement Pending. To accept the third-party scan request, click the application name to open the application overview.
