From the Completed Scans you can see a list of all the scans that have finished.

You can sort the list on any of the columns. Click a scan name to go to the Application Overview page of that application. Click **View Results** to go to the results of that scan.

This page also provides a list of any [bookmarked reports](https://docs.veracode.com/r/using_bmarks) and all the logged activity during the scans.
