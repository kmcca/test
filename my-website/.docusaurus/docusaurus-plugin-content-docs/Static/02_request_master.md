Veracode supports scan processes for these two types of workflows:

**Internally developed scan workflow**

In this scenario, you own the intellectual property for the application that you want to scan and have access to the source code to remediate any detected flaws. You receive a detailed list of flaws in the application with remediation guidelines.

**Third-party scan workflow**

In this scenario, you are purchasing or have purchased the application from a third-party vendor who controls the intellectual property for the application. The vendor has access to the source code to remediate any flaws found. You receive a summary report with a security rating and a summary of the top flaw categories found in the application, and the vendor receives a detailed list of the detected flaws with remediation guidelines.

To request a scan of your internally developed application, you must perform the procedures described in these topics in this sequence:

1.  [Create an Application Profile](https://docs.veracode.com/r/request_profile)
2.  [Specify Which Teams Can Access an Application](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Assign_an_Application_to_Teams)
3.  [Choose a Scan Type](https://docs.veracode.com/r/scantype)
4.  [Upload a Packaged Application](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_upload_packaged)
5.  [Checking the Scan Status](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Checking_the_Scan_Status)
6.  [Reviewing the Estimated Completion Time for a Static Scan](https://docs.veracode.com/r/request_time)

To request a scan of an application developed by a third party, you must perform these procedures in this sequence:

1.  [Request a Third-Party Scan](https://docs.veracode.com/r/request_profile_cots)
2.  [Choose a Scan type](https://docs.veracode.com/r/scantype)
3.  [Checking the Scan Status](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Checking_the_Scan_Status)

If you are a vendor receiving a third-party scan request, you must perform these procedures in this sequence:

1.  [Reviewing and Accepting a Third-Party Scan Request](https://docs.veracode.com/r/request_cots_accept)
2.  [Upload a Packaged Application](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_upload_packaged)
3.  [Vendor Rescanning and Publishing](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_COTS_actions)
