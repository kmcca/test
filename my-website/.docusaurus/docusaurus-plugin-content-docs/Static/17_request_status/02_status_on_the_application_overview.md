You can view detailed information about the security policy and status of an application that Veracode is currently scanning.

The [application overview](https://docs.veracode.com/r/reviewing_the_scan_details) page displays information about the security policy and status for in-progress static scans for the selected application. It also displays a progress bar and the estimated completion date. After a scan has completed, you can click an action button to perform other tasks, such as **View Report** or **Triage Flaws**.
