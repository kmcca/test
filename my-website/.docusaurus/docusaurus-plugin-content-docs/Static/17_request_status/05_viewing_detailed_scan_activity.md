You can view the activity log to see details of the activities that occurred during the scan. This information includes the event type, username, and timestamp.

You can view the activity log for an application from the application page or the Scans page. You can view the activity log for a sandbox on the sandbox page. The activity log displays the scan activity for 90 days. To view older activity, [download the activity report](https://docs.veracode.com/r/wySvh2U7LWNYqeVS7PQm_g/mgqx_R~G4iMqMfs0dGOGnQ).

A delay can sometimes occur between when you perform an action and the refresh in the activity log. If your action is not visible in the log, do not repeat the UI action or API call. Wait a few minutes and, then, refresh the browser.
