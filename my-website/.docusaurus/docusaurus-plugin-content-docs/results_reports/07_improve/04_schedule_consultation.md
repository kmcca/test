Consultation calls provide you the opportunity to get assistance with configuring and running a scan or with interpreting the findings in your application. During scan configuration calls, Veracode can answer specific questions you have about your scan configuration or walk you through the best practices for setting up your scan. During scan results calls, Veracode can help you understand the significance of the findings and provide guidance on remediation and mitigation.

To enable consultation calls, you must meet these requirements:

-   You have an Enhanced Support subscription. If you have not purchased a subscription, contact support@veracode.com for more information about the support options.
-   You have the necessary Veracode Platform [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions):
    -   Scan configuration calls require the Creator, Security Lead, or Submitter role.
    -   Scan results calls for policy scans require the Executive, Reviewer, or Security Lead role.
    -   Scan results calls for sandbox scans require the Sandbox User role.
-   For scan results calls, you have results available.

If you have a scan configuration call scheduled, you cannot schedule any additional consultations for your application.

You can have one scan results call scheduled at a time for policy scans in addition to one for each sandbox.
