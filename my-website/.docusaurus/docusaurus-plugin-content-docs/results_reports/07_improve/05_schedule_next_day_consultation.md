You can schedule a consultation for the following day if you have a next-day consultation subscription. A consultation call with Veracode can help answer specific questions you have about your scan results, help you understand the significance of the findings, and provide guidance on remediation and mitigations.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

To enable next-day consultation calls, you must meet these requirements:

-   You have a next-day consultation subscription.
-   Next-day consultations are allowed in your [application profile](https://docs.veracode.com/r/request_profile).
-   You have scan results.
-   You have the necessary Veracode Platform [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions):
    -   Calls for policy scans require the Executive, Reviewer, or Security Lead role.
    -   Calls for sandbox scans require the Sandbox User role.

1.  In the Veracode Platform, go to the Results page for the most recent scan of your application.

2.  Click the **Schedule a Consultation** button.

    A window opens where you can enter details about the call.

3.  Select the **Show Next-Day Consultations** checkbox, if available.

    Under the checkbox, you can view the number of next-day consultation calls available to you this month. If you have no next-day consultations this month or you do not want to use a next-day consultation, do not select the **Show Next-Day Consultations** checkbox. Standard scheduling options are available for two business days from the date of the request.

4.  Click **Next**.

5.  Select a time for the call.

    If the time slot is grayed out, that time is unavailable.

6.  Click **Schedule**.
