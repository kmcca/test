From the Results page, you can view the Veracode and PCI Compliance reports to gain insights into your application security program activity and a better understanding of the business risk of vulnerabilities in your application. In addition, you can download reports, bookmark reports, share results, and schedule a consultation.

Click **Veracode Report** or **PCI Compliance Report** to open these reports. The [Veracode Report](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_veracode_report) summarizes the security flaws identified during this scan, how the application fared against the associated policy controls, and outlines the Veracode recommendations. The Veracode Report contains the same information as the [Detailed Report](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_download_detailed_report) that you can download from the Results page.

The [PCI Compliance Report](https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_pci) provides guidance on how to fix the discovered flaws to achieve Payment Card Industry \(PCI\) compliance and how the application fared against the PCI policy.

The [Customizable Report](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_veracode_report) is the only Veracode report that includes Veracode Software Composition Analysis data.
