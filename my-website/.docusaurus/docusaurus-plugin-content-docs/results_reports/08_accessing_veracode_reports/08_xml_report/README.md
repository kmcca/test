Veracode exports, in XML format, detailed information about an application, including some application profile data, information about scans performed, Software Composition Analysis \(SCA\) data if available, and a list of open and fixed flaws. You can download this information from the Results page. The format for the download is the same as that provided by the [Results API](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_results_main).

1. In the Veracode Platform, select **My Portfolio** > **Applications**.

2. Find an application with scan results and click **Results**.

3. Click **Download** > **XML Report**.

4. Click **Download**.

    The report is downloaded to your browser. Veracode provides the report as a ZIP file that contains the XML document and the associated XSD XML schema for using the XML information in another application.
