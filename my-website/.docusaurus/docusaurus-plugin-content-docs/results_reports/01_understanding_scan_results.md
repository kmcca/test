During security scanning, Veracode uses specific methodologies and techniques to determine the overall security score of your applications. Veracode provides the scan results in various reports, which you can review to understand the security of your applications and to determine the next steps for addressing security findings.

These topics explain the methodologies and techniques that Veracode uses to produce a security score of your applications:

[**About the Veracode Methodology**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_methodology)
   
Veracode uses multiple analysis techniques to provide a consolidated application security rating.

[**About Business Criticality**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_assurancelevels)

Your application security policy is based on the business criticality for the application or the level of risk the application can tolerate based on its anticipated use.

[**Scoring Methodology**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_scoringmethodology)

The Veracode scoring system is based on industry-standard classifications of security findings and exploit impact.

[**Veracode and the CWE**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_review_cwe)

Veracode uses the industry standard Common Weakness Enumeration \(CWE\) as a taxonomy for findings.

[**Understanding Severity and Exploitability**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_severity_exploitability)

Severity and exploitability are different measures of the seriousness of a finding.

[**Best Practice Findings**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_bestpractices)
