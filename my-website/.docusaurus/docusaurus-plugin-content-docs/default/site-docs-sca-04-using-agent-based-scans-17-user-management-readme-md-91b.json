  "description": "For organizations with many users, it can be difficult to manage direct assignments. Teams can alleviate this manual work by providing a container for users who require the same level of access to the same workspaces. Add the teams to the right workspaces with the desired role, and all users in the team automatically inherit those permissions. When one person changes teams, remove the user from the old team and assign the user to the new team.",
