  "description": "The foundation of the Veracode rating system is the concept that more critical applications require higher security quality scores to be acceptable risks. Less business critical applications can tolerate lower security quality. The business criticality is dictated by the typical deployed environment and the value of data used by the application. Factors that determine business criticality are: reputation damage, financial loss, operational risk, sensitive information disclosure, personal safety, and legal violations.",
