  "description": "After fixing flaws in your application that Veracode identified, you should scan your application again. A subsequent scan is necessary to verify that the fixes were effective and that additional security flaws were not introduced by the fixes. The first step in verifying your fixes is to submit a new scan of your application. Once the scan is complete, a number of features are provided in the Veracode Platform and in the application report.",
