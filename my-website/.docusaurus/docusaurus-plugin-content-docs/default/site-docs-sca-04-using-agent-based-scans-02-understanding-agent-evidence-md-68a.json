  "description": "Because the scanning process consists of building the code to be scanned, generating a dependency graph from the built code, and identifying libraries used with the dependency graph, Veracode Software Composition Analysis agent-based scanning requires the source code of the repository you want to scan in order to function properly. Libraries are identified by sending information to Veracode to match against the Veracode database. This section provides details on what information is sent from your environment to Veracode.",
