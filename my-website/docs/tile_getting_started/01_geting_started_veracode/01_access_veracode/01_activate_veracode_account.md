You can log in to the Veracode Platform after an Administrator creates an account for you.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

-   A user with the Administrator [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions) in the Veracode Platform has created a [Veracode account](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_about_veracode_accounts) associated with your email address.
-   Your web browser meets the [minimum requirements](https://docs.veracode.com/r/using_browser).

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

After the Administrator creates your account, you receive a welcome email from Veracode.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  Click **Activate Account** in the Veracode welcome email.

    This button opens your browser to the Veracode welcome page.

    <p style="background-color:#FFFCF3; padding: 12px; border-left: 5px solid #F7CD55;">
    <b>Note:</b> The activation button is valid for seven days. If you do not activate your account before it expires, an Administrator in your organization must send another activation link.</p>
