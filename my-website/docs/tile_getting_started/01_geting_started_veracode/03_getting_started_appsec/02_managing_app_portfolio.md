The Veracode Platform enables you to manage all the applications in the portfolio for your organization. One of the first tasks you perform in the Veracode Platform is to input all the information about the applications that you want to analyze.

Select from these tasks:

-   [Add one application](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_add_application) to the portfolio.
-   [Bulk-add several applications at one time](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_bulk_add_applications) to the portfolio.
-   [Edit an existing application profile](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_edit_application_profile).
