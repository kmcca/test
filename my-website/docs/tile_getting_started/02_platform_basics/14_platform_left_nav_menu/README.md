The left navigation menu in the Veracode Platform is your key point of reference when moving between the application profile, scan requests, and scan results. The left navigation menu is always visible while you are working with applications and scans. The menu is collapsible for you to hide at any time by using the tab at the top of the menu.

The left navigation is divided into four major sections:

- Application
