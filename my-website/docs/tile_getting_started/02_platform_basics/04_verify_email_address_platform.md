Verifying the email address you use for your Veracode account improves security and allows you to access the Veracode Community directly from the Veracode Platform.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

You can initiate email address verification for your own user account or an [Administrator can initiate it](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Request_User_Email_Verification). If you access the Veracode Platform through [single sign-on](https://docs.veracode.com/r/about_saml), Veracode prompts you to verify your email when you log in.

<b>Note:</b> You cannot edit the email address for your user account without verifying the new address.</p>

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  In the Veracode Platform, select **Your Account** from the top menu.

    If your email address is not verified, a message appears recommending that you verify it.

2.  Click the **Send verification email** link.

    Veracode sends you an email with a subject line of `Action Required: Verify Email Address`. If you edit your email address, Veracode sends the email to your new address.

3.  In the email you receive from Veracode, click **Verify Email**.

    A confirmation page states that your email address is now verified.
