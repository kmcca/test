You can bookmark scan results reports in the Veracode Platform for easy retrieval. Bookmarked reports provide a snapshot of flaws and policy compliance at a specific point in time.

From the Results page, click **Bookmark this Report**, and enter a name for the report.

After you save the name of the report, the title of the Results page changes to the name of the bookmark. The name also appears in the left navigation menu.

To retrieve a bookmarked report at a later time, go to the Scans page and select the report from the Bookmarked Reports section.
