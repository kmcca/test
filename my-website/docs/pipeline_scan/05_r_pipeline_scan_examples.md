Veracode provides code examples that you can add as a stage in a development pipeline job for running a Pipeline Scan. You add the Pipeline Scan stage after the stage that builds your application.

These examples include scripts to download and extract the [pipeline-scan-LATEST.zip](01_getstarted_pipeline_scan/03_t_download_pipeline_scan.md) archive to ensure your pipeline is using the latest files. The README file in the `pipeline-scan-LATEST.zip` archive also contains these examples. The [example configuration scenarios](10_c_pipeline_scan_config_scenarios.md) provide a few common configurations you can use as a reference. For additional code examples or to ask questions, visit the [Veracode Community](https://community.veracode.com/s/?utm_medium=help_center_+community_section&utm_source=veracode_help_center).
