You can add a Pipeline Scan as a step in a GitHub Actions workflow. You can use the YAML code examples this section to configure GitHub Action workflows for building a project and running the Pipeline Scan as a step in the workflow.

The Pipeline Scan code examples include variables for your [Veracode API credentials](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_api_credentials3). Ensure these variables correctly reference your API ID and key stored in your CI/CD code repository.

Veracode provides these packaged applications on GitHub: [VeraDemoDotNet](https://github.com/veracode/verademo-dotnet) and [VeraDemo](https://github.com/veracode/verademo). You can use these applications for testing, debugging, or for demos if you do not have an application that meets the packaging requirements for a specific scan type. You can download these applications or connect them to a CI/CD code repository.

Veracode also provides preconfigured [GitHub Actions in the GitHub Marketplace](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_about_github).
