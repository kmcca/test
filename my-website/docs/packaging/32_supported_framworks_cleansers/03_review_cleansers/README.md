If you suspect that an attacker compromised data in your applications, you can use cleansing functions to resolve the modifications before the data reaches a potentially vulnerable location.

Not every function is valid in every attack circumstance. For example, you might need to use a different function to protect against cross-site scripting attacks in an HTML attribute instead of in a form field. Be aware of the context in which you are using the function.
