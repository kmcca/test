Veracode provides solutions to resolve third-party dependencies that prevent Xcode from building iOS applications with the accompanying bitcode.

If an application does not provide third-party dependencies in its source, Xcode cannot build bitcode.

Veracode recommends two solutions for building an application prior to scanning:

-   [Replacing a Library Using Conditional Compilation Blocks](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Replacing_a_Library_Using_Conditional_Compilation_Blocks)
-   [Configure Xcode to Replace Third-Party Libraries](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Configure_Xcode_to_Replace_Third_Party_Libraries)

See iOS Bitcode Packaging for Third Party Dependencies in the [Veracode Community](https://community.veracode.com/) for additional information about these solutions.
