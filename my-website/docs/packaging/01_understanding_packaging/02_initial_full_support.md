You can see the phrases "Initial support" and "Supported" throughout this Veracode Packaging Requirements publication. They refer to two different development phases at which Veracode releases scan support for a language or framework.

**Initial support**

Indicates that Veracode has implemented initial coverage for a new version of a language or platform or a new framework. Support for new functionality in this framework, language, or platform version is not fully implemented and may affect the quality of your scan results.

**Supported**

Indicates that Veracode has implemented enhanced coverage for a framework, language, or platform. The Veracode security research team has analyzed the supported technology for security risks, and checks have been added for functionality in the framework or language/platform version to improve findings. Veracode uses the relevant artifacts uploaded with the application, including configuration files and other metadata, to analyze the application.
