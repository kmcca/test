Your Ionic applications must meet specific compilation requirements before you can submit them for scanning.

See [Supported Languages and Platforms](https://docs.veracode.com/r/r_supported_table) for instructions for other platforms.

Upload a compressed ZIP archive containing all Ionic source code to Veracode. Do not submit files that you built using webpack or other packaging mechanisms. Ensure your source files are UTF-8 encoded.
