When you set the business criticality for the application, the Veracode Platform automatically assigns a policy to an application, based on the [default policy rules](https://docs.veracode.com/r/policy_setdefaults) of the organization. If you have the Policy Administrator [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions), you can override the default policy on an application in the application profile.
