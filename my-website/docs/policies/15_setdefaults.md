You can set default policies that Veracode automatically assigns to newly created applications.

You must have the Policy Administrator [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions) to set default policies.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

1.  Click **Policies** \> **Policy Settings**.
2.  For each business criticality, select the policy to be assigned by default.
3.  Click **Save**.
