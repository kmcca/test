When creating a policy, you can define the dates on which findings can impact the policy compliance of your applications. Findings that are opened or reopened during the evaluation timeframe can cause an application to not pass policy.

You set an evaluation timeframe to apply to findings before or after a specific date. For example, if you are starting work tomorrow to update a legacy application and your goal is to avoid adding new security flaws, you can define the evaluation timeframe as on or after the current date. In this case, new findings can cause the application to not pass policy, but old findings cannot.

Evaluation timeframes do not apply to Minimum Scan Score and Component Blocklist Enforcement rules.
