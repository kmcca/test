When using Greenlight for Eclipse, icons in the Project Explorer provide an at-a-glance status of the files included in each scan.

-   ![](../../images/greenlt_icon-scan-inprogress.png): scan in progress
-   ![](../../images/greenlt_icon-scan-no-flaws.png): no findings found
-   ![](../../images/greenlt_scan_fail.png): scan failed
-   ![](../../images/greenlt_icon-scan-has-flaw.png): findings found

You can see the progress of a scan in the bottom right of the Eclipse window. The scan times out after one minute if there are any issues.
