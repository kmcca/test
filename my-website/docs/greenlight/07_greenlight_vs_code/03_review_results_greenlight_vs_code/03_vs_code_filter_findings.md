You can filter results in VS Code so that you can focus on the findings that are the most relevant and important to you.

- You meet the [Greenlight prerequisites](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Meet_Veracode_Greenlight_Prerequisites).
- You have [run a Greenlight scan in VS Code](https://veracode-test3.fluidtopics.net/r/c_scanning_with_vs_code).

The filter action is local to you to be able to filter out findings in the Greenlight results based on severity or CWE type. You can clear a filter at any time and all filters are cleared when you restart the IDE.
