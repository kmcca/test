You can use Veracode for VS Code to scan either a single file or all files in a folder.

Before you can scan C# projects, you must have the C# for Visual Studio Code extension installed. You can download this extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.

The C# for Visual Studio Code extension enables C# compilation for Visual Studio Code. Veracode for VS Code uses the extension to generate binaries for Greenlight scans.
