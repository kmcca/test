You can configure a one-time schedule for running a Dynamic Analysis web application scan or API specification scan.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

- You must have the Creator, Submitter, or Security Lead [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions) to schedule a Dynamic Analysis.
- You have created a Dynamic Analysis and clicked **Schedule** at the bottom of the page.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

By default, your Dynamic Analysis is not scheduled. When you are ready to run it, you can start your Dynamic Analysis immediately or schedule it to run at a date up to 90 days in the future. You can also configure the scan to run on a [recurring schedule](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_was_recurring).

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1. On the Dynamic Analysis Schedule and Prescan page, in the Frequency field, select **Once**.
 
3. Select **Save for Later** if you do not want to schedule your Dynamic Analysis, but you want to save the analysis to submit later.

4. Select **Prescan Only** if you want to run a prescan instead of a full scan.

    To allow time for the prescan, you must schedule your analysis at least two hours in the future.

5. Select **Once** to configure a one-time schedule.

    a. Click the calendar icon and select the date and time on which you want the scan to start.

    b. In the Analysis Duration field, enter the maximum number of days you want the Dynamic Analysis to run.

    c. Click **Preview Schedule**.

      The Schedule Summary opens, showing your selections for the schedule.

6. Click **Review and Submit** to save your options and move to the final step in starting your Dynamic Analysis.

From the All Dynamic Analyses list, you can review the schedule of any Dynamic Analysis by clicking the clock icon in the row for that Dynamic Analysis. The respective schedule opens, providing at-a-glance information.

If a Dynamic Analysis is scheduled to run only once or if the recurrence timeframe has ended, you can verify the status of the schedule to see if any more occurrences are scheduled.

1. In the All Dynamic Analyses list, select **Configure Analysis** from the Actions ![](../images/actions_icon.png) menu in the row of the Dynamic Analysis that you want to check.

2. At the bottom of the Edit screen, click **Schedule**.
3. On the Edit Schedule page, you can see if the Dynamic Analysis is saved or scheduled to run again. 
 
   If there is a schedule in place that you want to cancel, select **Cancel**. Click **Review and Submit**. If you want to run the Dynamic Analysis again with the same configuration, you can edit the schedule to rerun on your new selected day and time.
