Veracode works with you to build custom rules for web application firewalls \(WAF\). You can use these rules to block potential attacks based on the results of your dynamic scans.

Veracode helps you to create robust rules for each level of flaws that you find in your application scan details. WAF rules enable your application layer firewall to automatically remediate vulnerabilities as soon as they are detected. Web application firewalls are a common part of the web application security landscape. A core challenge when using a WAF is properly configuring the WAF rules; a firewall is only as good as its rules. Veracode assists you in creating rules using either ModSecurity or Imperva.
