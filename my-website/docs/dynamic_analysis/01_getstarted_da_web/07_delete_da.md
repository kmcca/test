You can delete a Dynamic Analysis if no instances of the Dynamic Analysis are running. You must have the Creator or Security Lead [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions) to be able to delete a Dynamic Analysis.

To delete a Dynamic Analysis, in the list of all Dynamic Analysis scans, go to the Actions menu at the end of the row of the analysis you want to delete, and click the delete icon ![](../images/trash_icon.png). When prompted, confirm that you want to permanently remove all results and URL configurations for this Dynamic Analysis.
