From the Scans & Analysis menu, select **Dynamic Analysis** to open the Dynamic Analysis page.

The visibility settings of an analysis control which roles can access it. If you have the Security Lead [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions), you can see all the analyses for your organization.

In the All Dynamic Analyses table, you can filter the list of analyses by their status using the filter dropdown menu or search for a specific analysis by name or URL in the search box. If you click an analysis in the search results and navigate away from the page, if you navigate back to the All Dynamic Analyses page, the same list of analyses is visible. This feature enables you to see the filtered list without needing to do a search again on the same status, name, or URL. The data in the table refreshes automatically.
