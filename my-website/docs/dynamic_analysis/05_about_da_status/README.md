You can view Dynamic Analysis scans to verify status updates. All actions and statuses are available in the activity log located at the bottom of the Dynamic Analysis summary page.

After you have submitted your Dynamic Analysis, you can return to the list of Dynamic Analysis scans at any time to verify status updates. If you have numerous Dynamic Analysis scans, you can search for the one you want to view by entering a search string and clicking **Find**.

This table lists all the possible statuses for a Dynamic Analysis.

You can filter on the specific status of the Dynamic Analysis scans if you want to only see a list of the scans that are in a specific state. In the Filter by Status dropdown menu, select the status on which you want to filter.

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">URL Scan Status</span></p>

You can view the status of a specific URL scan in a Dynamic Analysis on the **Scan Details** tab.

The URL scan status provides additional information about the individual scan associated with the URL, which can differ from the status of the overall analysis. The URL scan status is also displayed in the list of URLs on the Dynamic Analysis Summary page.

| URL Scan Status                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
