You can unlink results when you no longer want to associate them with a specific application or to link them to a different application. You can perform this in the Veracode Platform or with the REST APIs.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

You must have the Security Lead, Creator, or Submitter [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions).

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

After unlinking results from an [application profile](https://docs.veracode.com/r/request_profile), all future scan results are no longer associated with that application. The results from previous scans remain available and you can link them to the same or a different application profile.

You can also use the [Dynamic Analysis REST API](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Unlink_Dynamic_Analysis_Results_from_an_Application_with_the_REST_API).
