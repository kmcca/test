In some situations, timing restraints, budgetary considerations, or strategic planning purposes may require limiting the level of effort for penetration testing.

Veracode Penetration Testers may choose to customize the methodology to focus on high-priority, business-relevant flaws. For example, the tester may choose to focus on finding representative examples of higher risk flaws such as injection, authentication, and authorization flaws.
