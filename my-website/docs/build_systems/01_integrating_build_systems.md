Veracode provides integrations and APIs to enable you to integrate application security with your build servers and release-management processes.

Whether you are developing code using continuous integration or a more traditional development model, your security tools should support the model and developer tools that make your team most productive. The addition of application security testing should not require your team to change how they interact with their code, how they identify and work defects, or how they interact with software configuration management \(SCM\) tools. Veracode is designed to be open- and tool-chain agnostic, and to not require changes to overall development process. Veracode achieves this goal by offering plugins and APIs that integrate smoothly into your SDLC.

<b>Note:</b> Veracode APIs and integrations require access to <code>analysiscenter.veracode.com</code> and <code>api.veracode.com</code>. Contact your IT team to ensure these domains are on the allowlist for your organization and that there is one-way communication on port 443 to <code>api.veracode.com</code>. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.veracode.com/r/IP_addresses">complete list of domains and IP addresses to add to your allowlist</a>. Also, ensure you access the APIs with the <a href="https://docs.veracode.com/r/Region_Domains_for_Veracode_APIs">domain for your region</a>.</p>
