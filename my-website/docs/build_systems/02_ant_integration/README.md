You can use the [Veracode Java API wrapper](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_about_wrappers) to integrate Veracode [Static Analysis](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_static_overview) with Apache Ant. The integration seamlessly adds static scanning into the existing build processes that you use in your Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

You install and integrate the API wrapper on the build server and the wrapper uses the [Veracode APIs](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_api_main) to establish communication between the build server and Veracode. During application builds, the wrapper uploads your code to Veracode for scanning.
