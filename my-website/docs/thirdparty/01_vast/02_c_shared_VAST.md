Third-party vendors can make the results of their Veracode scans available to enterprise clients. To enable the sharing of Veracode reports, contact Veracode Technical Support.

After Veracode scans their applications and publishes the results, vendors can then share the reports with enterprise clients. After vendors share the reports, the reports are visible in the Shared Reports list on the application overview page. From the application overview page, the enterprise client can view these items:

-   Policy evaluation score for the latest scans of the application
-   List of reports currently shared with your organization for this application

Click the report name or the **Download** link to view and save the report.

Shared reports remain available until the vendor chooses to unshare them.
