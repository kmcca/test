Veracode performs a prescan verification after uploading your application for static analysis. The prescan verification performs an initial analysis of the application to verify you have packaged the application correctly.

A prescan fails if there are any fatal or blocking errors identified for the uploaded application.

After prescan verification, the scan automatically begins if you chose the **Auto-Scan** option. Otherwise, you can select the modules to submit for scanning.
