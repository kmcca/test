**Website**

The location connected to the internet, identified by the hostname of the URL that you normally see in a browser address bar. It can take many forms such as `http://xyz.com`, `xyz.com`, `xyz.com/subdomain`, or `https://xyz.com:443`.

**Uniform Resource Locator \(URL\)**

   A URL is one type of Uniform Resource Identifier \(URI\), the generic term for all types of names and addresses that refer to objects on the internet. The term web address is a synonym for a URL that uses the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.

**Hostname**

   A label assigned to a device connected to a computer network that is used to identify the device in various forms of electronic communication. On the internet, hostnames may have appended the name of a Domain Name System \(DNS\) domain, separated from the host-specific label by a period. In the latter form, some hostnames are also called domain names. If the domain name is completely specified, including a top-level domain of the internet, then the hostname is a fully qualified domain name.

**Uniform Resource Identifier \(URI\)**

   A string of characters that identify a resource. Identifying a resource enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the internet, using specific protocols. Schemes specify a concrete syntax and associated protocols that define each URI. The most common form of URI is the Uniform Resource Locator \(URL\), frequently referred to informally as a web address.

**Protocol**

   The special set of rules that endpoints in a telecommunication connection use when they communicate. Protocols specify interactions between the communicating entities.

**Domain Name**

   The part of a network address that identifies the site as belonging to a particular domain.

**Fully-Qualified Domain Name \(FQDN\)**

   The complete domain name for a specific computer, or host, on the internet. The FQDN consists of two parts, the hostname and the domain name. For example, an FQDN for a hypothetical mail server might be `mail.college.edu`. The hostname is `mail` and the host is located within the domain `college.edu`.

**Subdomain**

   A subdomain is a domain that is part of a larger domain. The only domain that is not also a subdomain is a root domain. For example, `west.example.com` and `east.example.com` are subdomains of the `example.com` domain, which is a subdomain of the `.com` top-level domain \(TLD\).

**Top-Level Domain**

   One of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the internet. The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone of the name space. For all domains in lower levels, it is the last part of the domain name. For example, in the domain name `www.example.com`, the top-level domain is `.com`. The responsibility of managing most top-level domains is delegated to specific organizations by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers \(ICANN\), which operates the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority \(IANA\), and is responsible for maintaining the DNS root zone.

**Internet Protocol \(IP\) Address**

   An identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol \(TCP/IP\) network. Networks using the TCP/IP protocol route messages based on the IP address of the destination.
