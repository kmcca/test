You can create a sandbox to provide a temporary store of your security analysis of an application.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

If you have the Creator, Security Lead, or Sandbox Administrator role, you can create sandboxes.

<p style="background-color:#FFFCF3; padding: 12px; border-left: 5px solid #F7CD55;">
<b>Note:</b> The sandbox feature is not available to third-party vendors whose software Veracode scans on behalf of an enterprise.</p>

You access the Sandboxes page from the left navigation menu on the Application page. The Sandboxes page for each application contains two views:

-   My Sandboxes
-   Everyone's Sandboxes

Everyone who has access to this application and has the correct sandbox permissions can create sandboxes for the application. You can change the view between the list of all sandboxes and the list of only your sandboxes.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  Go to the application and click **Sandboxes** in the left navigation menu.

2.  On the Sandboxes page, click **Create Sandbox**.

3.  In the Create Sandbox window, enter the name of your new sandbox.

4.  If you are in the [time-to-live mode](01_c_about_sandbox/01_c_sandbox_data_retention.md), to specify your preference when the sandbox expiration period starts, select the **Automatically re-create this sandbox when the seven-day expiration period starts** checkbox.

    Your new sandbox now appears in My Sandboxes and Everyone's Sandboxes lists.

5.  To edit the sandbox name, click the pencil icon ![](images/pencil_icon.png) next to the name.

6.  Click the sandbox name in the list to go to the overview page for that sandbox.

    The number of remaining sandboxes appears in the Sandboxes section of the Application page and on the Sandboxes page.
