Within Eclipse, you create a development sandbox into which you upload your files and, then, you can run a scan from the sandbox.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  Go to **Veracode** \> **Upload and Scan**.

2.  If prompted, enter your Veracode API username and password, and select **Store username and password** so that you only have to enter your credentials one time.

3.  In the Application field, select the application from the dropdown menu.

4.  In the Scan Type row, select **Sandbox Scan**.

5.  Click **Create Sandbox**.

6.  Enter a name for the sandbox.

    If you do not see this button, contact Veracode Technical Support to enable this feature for your account.

7.  In the Workspace Files table, use the browse icon to select the files you want to upload from your current projects.

8.  Click **Add** to select any files not associated with a current project.

9.  Select **Upload**.

10. When prompted, click **Yes** to continue the upload.

11. When prompted, click **Yes** to go directly to the Veracode prescan process after the upload.

    If you do not want the full scan to continue automatically, click **No** and, when ready, click **Begin Prescan** at the top of the Upload Files table.
