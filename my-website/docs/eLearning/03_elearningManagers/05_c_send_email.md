On the **All Courses** tab, you can contact eLearning team members to prompt them to finish an incomplete course, retake a failed course, or congratulate them for passing a course. To email team members, click the envelope icon in the Action column. An email message is displayed, populated with a recipients list and email text. You can choose to send the email to the users who have passed, failed, or did not complete the course. You can edit the recipients, subject line, and body of the email as needed. Click **Send**.
