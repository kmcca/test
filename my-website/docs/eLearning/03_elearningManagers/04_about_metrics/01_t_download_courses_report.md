You can generate a report for the course progress of your learners.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

The scope of the progress reports depends on the role assigned to the eLearning manager. eLearning managers can only generate reports for learners that they manage. A user with the [Executive and eLearning roles](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions) can generate reports for all learners in an organization. The report includes:

-   Learner names
-   Manager names
-   Course names
-   Curriculum
-   Curriculum start date
-   Track names
-   Whether courses are required
-   Course due dates
-   Status of courses started and courses completed
-   Course grades

1.  In the Veracode Platform, go to **Security Training** \> **My Team's Courses**.

2.  Click **Generate New Report**.

    When you return to the My Team's Courses page, a link to download the report becomes available and shows the date on which you generated the report.

3.  Click the link to download the report in XLSX format.

    The progress report indicates an error condition in this scenario:

    -   You enabled Learner Levels.
    -   A technical issue prevents the Veracode Platform from including the Learner Level Summary for some learners.
