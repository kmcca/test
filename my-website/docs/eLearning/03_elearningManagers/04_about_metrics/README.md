You can measure the success of an eLearning program by reviewing learner performance on courses.

You can download eLearning metrics, including grades, course dates, progress data, and other information. The data is available as an Excel file. The file includes data for those learners that you manage.

<p style="background-color:#FFFCF3; padding: 12px; border-left: 5px solid #F7CD55;"><b>Note:</b> If you have the Executive <a href="https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions">role</a> you can generate a report that includes curriculum data for all learners in your organization. If you do not have the Executive role, you can generate a report only for your learners.</p>
