You can manage course access and manager assignments for groups of eLearning learners.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

As an administrator, you might have to manage large numbers of users, including learners enrolled in eLearning courses. Onboarding new users consists of adding new users, assigning [user roles](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions), including the eLearning role, and, optionally, assigning these learners to [teams](https://docs.veracode.com/r/admin_team). Your organization might include hundreds of learners who belong to different teams and are assigned to different curricula. After initially assigning these settings for learners, you might need to make changes later.

You can set or modify several values, including curriculum and track assignments and eLearning manager, for a set of learners, in one operation, instead of setting values for learners one at a time. On the All Learners page, you can filter groups of users and use the Filter By and Actions dropdown menus to manage those learners.

    The Administration page opens.

2.  Click the **eLearning** tab.

3.  Scroll down to the Learners section to view a list of all learners.

4.  Use the Filter By dropdown menu to filter the learners by any of these options:

    -   Auto-Extend: select **No** or **Yes** to filter learners by those who have the Auto-Extend option selected for their tracks.
    -   Courses Accessed: select **No** or **Yes** to filter learners by those who have accessed their courses.
    -   Curriculum Assignment: select from the list of curricula to filter learners by those assigned to a specific curriculum. If you select **No Curriculum**, you filter those learners who are not assigned to a curriculum.
    -   Learner: enter all or part of a learner name to filter learners by that name.
    -   Manager: select from the list of managers to filter learners assigned to that manager. If you select **No Manager**, you filter those learners who do not have a manager.
    -   Team: select from the list of teams to filter learners assigned to that team. If you select **No Team**, you filter those learners who are not assigned to a team.
    -   Track: select from the list of tracks to filter learners by those assigned to those tracks.

    After selecting any of these options, click **Filter** to apply the filters to the list of learners. Click **Clear All** to clear all filters.

5.  After filtering learners, select the learners. Select the checkbox next to the Learner Name heading in the table. This action opens a window allowing you to select all learners in the filtered set on the current page or all learners in the filtered set on all pages.

6.  Use the Actions dropdown menu to select the actions to apply to the selected learners:

    -   Auto-Extend: select **No** or **Yes** to set the Auto Extend option for the selected tracks in the Track Assignment column.
    -   Curriculum: select a curricula to assign to selected learners. If you select **No Curriculum**, you remove all curriculum assignments for selected learners.
    -   Manager: select from the list of managers to assign to selected learners. If you select **No Manager**, you remove the manager assignment for selected learners.
    -   Track: select from the list of tracks to assign to selected learners. If you select **Unassigned**, you remove track assignments for selected learners.

    After selecting one of these options, click **Apply** to apply the actions to the selected learners.

    If the action is successful, a confirmation message displays.
