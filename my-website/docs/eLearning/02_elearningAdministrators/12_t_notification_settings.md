You can manage which email notifications to send to eLearning learners and managers.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

You can send an email message to learners and their managers when:

-   You assign the curriculum to learners.
-   You change the due date after you assign the curriculum.
-   The due date has passed and learners have not completed the curriculum.

These notification preferences apply to a specific curriculum. By default, all notifications are set to **Off**.
