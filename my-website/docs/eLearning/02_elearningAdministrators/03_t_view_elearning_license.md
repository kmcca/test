You can view a summary of eLearning seat usage, including a count of total eLearning seats purchased and assigned, and of all used eLearning seats.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

Assigning the eLearning role to a user consumes one of your purchased eLearning seats when the learner launches a course. If a learner does not launch any courses, you can assign the role to another user. You can only assign as many roles as you have purchased seats.

You can view these details about your eLearning seats:

- Track Name: the collection of courses to which the learner has access, based on the options your organization purchased.
- Total Seats in Subscription: the total number of seats your organization purchased.
- Users with Track Assigned/Total Seats: the number of seats in this track that are currently assigned to learners, compared to the number of seats your organization purchased.
- Seats Used: the number of eLearning seats your organization consumed.
- Seats Used by Active Users: the number of seats consumed by learners who have active accounts in the Veracode Platform. You cannot reassign these seats to other learners.
- Seats Used by Deleted Users: the number of seats consumed by learners whose accounts were deleted by the Veracode Platform. If the learner did use any eLearning resources, Veracode automatically releases these seats.
- Users Set to Auto-Extend: the number of learners set to auto-extend, a feature that automatically renews the learner seat when the organization renews its subscription.
