You can create a new eLearning curriculum that includes a date when learners must complete the courses.

Only Veracode eLearning administrators can create curricula. You must have the [Administrator and eLearning roles](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions) to create a curriculum.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  From the gear icon ![](../../images/gear_icon.png) at the top of the Veracode Platform page, go to **Admin** \> **eLearning** \> **Settings and Curricula**.

2.  Click **Add New Curriculum**.

    The Add Curriculum page opens.

3.  Enter a name in the Curriculum Name field.

4.  From the Track dropdown menu, select a Veracode eLearning track.

    A page opens with a table of all courses included in the selected track.

5.  From the Due Date dropdown menu, select **Fixed**.

6.  Click the calendar icon ![](../../images/calendar.png) to open a calendar and, then, select a date.

    <p style="background-color:#FFFCF3; padding: 12px; border-left: 5px solid #F7CD55;"><b>Note:</b> The due date applies to required courses only.</p>

7.  Select courses to include in the curriculum:

    -   To select one course at a time, select the checkbox next to a course name.
    -   To select all courses in a track, select the **Course Name** checkbox in the table heading.

8.  Optionally, make the selected courses required for learners:

    -   To make a single course required, select the **Required** checkbox next to a course name.
    -   To make all selected courses required, select the **Required** checkbox in the table heading.
    If you do not make a course required, the course is optional.

9.  Click **OK**.

After you create the curriculum, the course listing shows courses as not started. Learners can access their course history by selecting **Transcript** on **eLearning** \> **My Courses**.
