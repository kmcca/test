<p style="background-color:#FFFCF3; padding: 12px; border-left: 5px solid #F7CD55;"><b>Note:</b> The <b>eLearning</b> tab appears on the Veracode Platform Administration page only if you have an eLearning license.</p>

The top portion shows details about [subscriptions](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_view_elearning_license).

The lower portion of the eLearning Administration page contains three tabs for accessing different settings:

**Learners**

   - Shows the learners and their status, including courses accessed, track and curriculum assignments, curriculum due dates, and compliance reset periods. This page shows only users who have the eLearning [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions).

   - You can [apply filters](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_assign_track_bulk) to refine the list of learners.

   - You can [modify the settings for an individual learner](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Modify_Individual_Learner_Settings) by clicking the edit icon ![](../images/pencil_icon.png) at the end of the row for that learner.

**eLearning Managers**   

   - Lists all eLearning managers. You can also:

     -   Create a new [eLearning manager](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_manage_elearning_managers)
