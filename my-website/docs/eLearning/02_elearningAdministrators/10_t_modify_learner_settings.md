1.  Click the gear icon ![](../images/gear_icon.png) in the upper-right corner of the Veracode Platform page, then select **Admin**.

    The Administration page opens.

2.  Click the **eLearning** tab on the Administration page.

3.  Scroll to the eLearners section to see a list of all learners.

4.  Select a learner and click the edit icon ![](../images/pencil_icon.png) at the end of the row.

    The Edit eLearning User Settings page for the selected learner opens.

5.  Configure one or more of these settings:

    **Track**:

       a.  From the Track dropdown menu, select the track to make available to the learner. The Available Curricula table shows the curricula from the selected track that you can assign to a learner.

       b.  In the Available Curricula table, click the **+** icon to assign a selected curriculum to the learner. Click **Add All** to select all curricula.

    **Auto-Extend**: select the **Auto-Extend** checkbox to enable [auto-extend](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_about_auto_extend). Clear the checkbox to disable auto-extend.

    **Managed By**: select a manager to assign to the learner, or select **No Manager** to remove the manager assignment for the learner.

    **eLearning Manager**: click **Yes** to assign the selected learner as an eLearning manager. If the learner is currently an eLearning manager, clicking **No** removes the manager assignment. If you remove the eLearning manager assignment, any learners who previously reported to that manager will no longer have a manager.

6.  Click **Save**.
