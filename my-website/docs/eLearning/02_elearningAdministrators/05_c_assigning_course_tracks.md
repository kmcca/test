Veracode provides course tracks to which you can assign learners.

You have these options for making courses available to learners:

-   Assign learners to a track
-   Assign learners to a curriculum within the assigned track

A track is a container for courses to which the learner has access. You can purchase two tracks from Veracode:

-   eLearning Course Catalog
-   eLearning Security Awareness

You create eLearning [course curricula](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_about_curriculum_dates) and specify courses as available or mandatory.

You cannot remove the eLearning [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions) for learners who are assigned to tracks until the current [subscription](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_view_elearning_license) period expires. When the subscription period expires, you can extend the current track, move the learner to a different track, or leave the learner unassigned to a track. Veracode recommends that you do not remove the eLearning role from the account of a learner who is not assigned to a track, because the learner might want to continue to access results from past courses.

If you have the Administrator [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions), you can:

-   Assign [individual learners to a track](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Modify_Individual_Learner_Settings)
-   Assign [multiple learners](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_assign_track_bulk) to tracks
-   Manage seat [auto-extend](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_about_auto_extend) settings
