You can clear the cache for the Veracode Integration for Jira Cloud when attempting to troubleshoot various issues.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

Occasionally, bugs may cause the Veracode Integration for Jira Cloud to enter an unstable state. Clearing the cache provides a partial fresh start and enables the integration to re-gather information that can avoid the originating bug or temporarily prevent a return to the unstable state.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  On the Veracode Integration page in Jira, go to the Troubleshooting section.

2.  Click **Clear Cache** to start again.

    After clearing the cache, the next [selective or one-time import](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_jira_cloud_import_findings) can take longer to complete as Jira has to download all new detailed reports.
