The Veracode integrations for ticketing and defect-tracking systems enable you to automatically create tickets and merge them into defect backlogs.

The tickets contain information about the production-level and sandbox vulnerabilities identified during Veracode application security scans. These tickets are then managed like all application bugs or defects and are automatically given a severity, assigned to developers, and prioritized.

   <p style="background-color:#FFFCF3; padding: 12px; border-left: 5px solid #F7CD55;"><b>Note:</b> Veracode APIs and integrations require access to <code>analysiscenter.veracode.com</code> and <code>api.veracode.com</code>. Contact your IT team to ensure these domains are on the allowlist for your organization and that there is one-way communication on port 443 to <code>api.veracode.com</code>. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.veracode.com/r/IP_addresses">complete list of domains and IP addresses to add to your allowlist</a>.</p>
