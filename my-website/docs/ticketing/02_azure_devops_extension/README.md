Veracode provides an extension for Azure DevOps and Team Foundation Server (TFS). You can use the extension to automatically import flaws and vulnerabilities as work items. Veracode discovers flaws during [Static Analysis](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_static_overview) scans and vulnerabilities during [Dynamic Analysis](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Dynamic_Analysis) or [Software Composition Analysis](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_integrated_benefits) (SCA) scans.
