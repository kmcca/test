The Policy Evaluation section of the Results page provides an overview of how the application fared against its associated policy.

The [policy evaluation](https://docs.veracode.com/r/policy_understand) indicates if the application was assessed against rules, required scans, and a remediation grace period. The [Veracode Level](https://docs.veracode.com/r/policy_veracodelevel) the application achieves is based on the security score it receives after the scans.

Click the scan names in the static, dynamic, and manual columns to go to the [overview pages](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_nav_app_menu) to see more details of the scan results.
