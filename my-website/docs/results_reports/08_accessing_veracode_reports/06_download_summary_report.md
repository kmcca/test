You can download a Summary Report to share summary information about the security quality of your application without sharing the details of the discovered findings.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

The Summary Report includes the application rating and security quality score. It also provides a summary of the number and types of findings that Veracode discovered during scanning. You can share this information with anyone without exposing the details of potentially exploitable findings.

The Summary Report provides a general summary of the overall security of the application while the [Detailed Report](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_download_detailed_report) provides a detailed list of findings, their location, and remediation guidance.

You can also get a Summary Report with the [Summary Report REST API](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_rest_summary_report_intro).
