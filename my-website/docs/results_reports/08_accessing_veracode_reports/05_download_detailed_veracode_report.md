You can generate a report of your application security findings to share vulnerability statistics of applications and websites with your stakeholders.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

You have the Executive, Reviewer, or Security Lead [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions).

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

The Detailed Veracode Report provides insights into your application security program activity and a better understanding of the business risk of vulnerabilities in your application. The Detailed Veracode Report contains the same information available in the [Customizable Report](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_download_custom_report), but without the ability to choose which sections to include in the report.

2. Find an application with scan results and click **Results**.
