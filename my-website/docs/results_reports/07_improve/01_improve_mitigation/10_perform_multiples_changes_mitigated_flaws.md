You can accept, reject, or comment on several flaws from the Mitigated Flaws Page.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  In the Mitigated Flaws page of the application, filter the list of flaws to find the ones you want to change.
2.  Check out the flaws, either one at a time using the checkbox next to the Id column, or by using the checkout button ![](../images/improve_checkout.png) in the header row to check them all out with one click.
3.  Click **Accept**, **Reject**, or **Comment**.
4.  Enter your comments on the action in the Change Multiple Flaws window, then click **Continue**. The screen refreshes, updates the number of accepted and rejected flaws at the top of the page, and the flaws are checked back in.

<p style="background-color:#FFFCF3; padding: 12px; border-left: 5px solid #F7CD55;">
<b>Note:</b> A user with the Mitigation Approver role who has access to your application can also check back in a flaw that you have checked out.
</p>

You can accept multiple flaws by checking them out and clicking **Accept**.
