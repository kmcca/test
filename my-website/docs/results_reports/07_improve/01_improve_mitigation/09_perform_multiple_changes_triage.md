You can change more than one flaw at once from the Triage Flaws page.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1. [Search](https://docs.veracode.com/r/improve_search) for the flaws you want to change.
2. Check out the flaws, either one at a time or by using the checkout button ![](../../images/improve_checkout.png) in the header row to check them all out with one click.
3. From **Select Action** dropdown menu at the top of the pane, select the action to perform on the selected flaws.
4. Click **Go**. Veracode confirms the number of flaws you are changing and prompts you for a description of the change.
5. Click **Continue**. The Veracode Platform applies the change to the checked-out flaws.
6. Clear the flaws one-by-one to check in all files, or use the check-in button ![](../../images/improve_checkin.png) in the header row to check in all files with one click.
7. To perform a multiple change, select the flaws to change and select an action from the **Select Action** dropdown menu. You must provide a comment to explain the multiple change.
