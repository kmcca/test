A user with the Mitigation Approver role can accept or reject proposed mitigations from the Triage Flaws page of your application. To see a list of proposed mitigations, in the [Search](https://docs.veracode.com/r/improve_search) field, select **Mitigation** and **= Mitigation Proposed**. To view all mitigations except the type you selected, click the equals icon again.

<b>Note:</b> You can only use the Triage Flaws page to accept mitigations for internally developed applications. To accept mitigations for third-party applications, use the Mitigated Flaws page.
