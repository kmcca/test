After you have the report for your application, you can improve its security quality using the Veracode Platform:

[**Develop a remediation plan**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_remediationplan)

The Veracode Triage Flaws page and associated reports provide actionable guidance on which flaws to fix in which order to get the fastest improvements in security.

[**Review static flaws**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_static_flaw_viewer)

A developer can use the Triage Flaws page to review static flaws in the context of the application source.

[**Search for a specific flaw in the Triage Flaws page**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/improve_search)

You can use many criteria to find subsets of flaws in the Triage Flaws page.

[**Mitigate flaws**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/improve_mitigation)

Development teams can use the flaw mitigation workflow to manage the process of fixing security vulnerabilities.

[**Review a third-party application as the vendor**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_thirdparty)

Request the scan results for a third-party application.

[**Evaluate your third-party components**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_about_SCA)

Use Software Composition Analysis to review the vulnerabilities in your third-party components.

**Submit a new scan for confirmation**

After you make the improvements, you should submit a new scan request for the application to verify your fixes.

[**Verify fixed flaws through reports**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_verify)

Specific features in Veracode reports help you verify that you have fixed the flaws.

[**Use Veracode Analytics to manage application risk**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_about_dashboards)

Veracode Analytics provides a view of your application risk and compliance across your entire application portfolio. It also allows you to compare your results to those of other Veracode users.

[**Supported cleansing functions**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/review_cleansers)

Use one of the cleansing functions that Veracode static scans recognize if you want Veracode to verify your fix.

[**Download an Archer feed of your application data**](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_about_archer)

Use the Archer API to integrate your Veracode application risk data with the Archer dashboard.
