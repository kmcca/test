The Veracode Platform allows you to view flaws found in code without debug symbols. Since source file and line number information is unavailable for these flaws, Veracode Provides other location information.

In the **Flaws** tab of the Triage Flaws page, the Source column contains the function prototype containing the flaw and the approximate location in the function body, by percentage, where the flaw occurs.

Clicking one of the flaws allows you to open a source file for reference. Veracode prompts you with the name of the class path containing the flaw.
