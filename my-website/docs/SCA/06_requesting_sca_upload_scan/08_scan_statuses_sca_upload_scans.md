The Veracode Platform displays the status of your Veracode Software Composition Analysis upload scans.

These statuses appear in the Veracode Platform when viewing Veracode Software Composition Analysis upload scans that have not completed:

- **Scan Initialized**: you have submitted the scan, but it has not started yet.

- **Scan In Progress**: the scan is in progress.

- **Scan Failed**: the Veracode SCA scan encountered an error. Verify that you packaged your application correctly and click **Try Again** to resubmit the scan without restarting the Static Analysis scan. If the failure persists, contact Veracode Technical Support.
