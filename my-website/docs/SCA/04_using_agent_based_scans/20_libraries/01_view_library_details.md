You can also perform this task with the [SCA Agent REST API](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_sourceclear_intro).

1.  Open the Veracode Platform to a workspace or project page and click **Libraries**.

2.  Click a library name in the Library column.

    Veracode SCA opens a new tab to the [Veracode Vulnerability Database](https://docs.veracode.com/r/About_the_Veracode_Vulnerability_Database), which displays details of the vulnerabilities associated with the library.
