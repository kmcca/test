You can edit custom rules if you want to change the security requirements for your workspace.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

You must have the Security Lead, Workspace Administrator, or Workspace Editor [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions).

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  In the Veracode Platform, select **Scans & Analysis** > **Software Composition Analysis**.
2.  Click the **Agent-Based Scan** tab.
3.  Either select a workspace to view workspace rules or click **Agent-Based Scan Settings** to view organization rules.
4.  Click **Rules**.

    The currently applied custom rules appear.

5.  Click **Edit**.

    The controls change from view-only mode to edit mode. The details of each control are collapsed by default.

6.  Make your adjustments, then click **Save**.

    For instructions on how to define a control, see [Structure of a Rule](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Structure_of_Controls_in_Agent_Based_Scanning_Rules) and [Adding, Removing, and Rearranging Controls](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Adding_Removing_and_Rearranging_Controls_in_Agent_Based_Scanning_Custom_Rules).


Once you save, the custom rules are active for any future scans in that workspace.
