For organizations with many users, it can be difficult to manage direct assignments. Teams can alleviate this manual work by providing a container for users who require the same level of access to the same workspaces. Add the teams to the right workspaces with the desired role, and all users in the team automatically inherit those permissions. When one person changes teams, remove the user from the old team and assign the user to the new team.

You perform all user management tasks [through the Veracode Platform](https://docs.veracode.com/r/admin_user).

For team management tasks that are not specific to agent-based scanning, see [Managing Teams](https://docs.veracode.com/r/admin_team).
