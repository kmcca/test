Veracode Software Composition Analysis (SCA) agent-based scanning supports automatically generating pull requests of GitHub and GitLab repositories to fix vulnerabilities identified in agent scans.

Using the information identified by the [update advisor](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_update_advisor), the automatic pull requests modify package dependency files and update the libraries to the recommended safe version.
