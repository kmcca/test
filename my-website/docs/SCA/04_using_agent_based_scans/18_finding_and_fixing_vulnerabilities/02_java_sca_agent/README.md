You can find vulnerabilities in your Java applications using Veracode Software Composition Analysis agent-based scanning. You can run a scan on Maven, Gradle, and Ant repositories using the [agent-based scanning command-line interface](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_sc_agent_usage) or the [CI integrations](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Integrate_Veracode_SCA_Agent_Based_Scanning_with_Your_CI_Projects).

For packaging instructions for Veracode Static Analysis and Veracode SCA upload scans, see [Packaging Java Applications](https://docs.veracode.com/r/compilation_java).
