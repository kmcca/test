On the Project Details page in the Veracode Platform, there is an option to watch a project.

If you have set a default branch from the [Default Branch setting](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_sc_default_branch), Veracode Software Composition Analysis updates your issues automatically when the Veracode security research team releases a new vulnerability that affects you. If you are watching a project, Veracode sends you an email notification when a change affects that project.
