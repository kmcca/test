<p><span style="font-size: medium;">View Vulnerabilities in Your Code</span></p>

You can navigate between [vulnerabilities](https://docs.veracode.com/r/View_SCA_Vulnerability_Details), [open-source libraries](https://docs.veracode.com/r/View_Library_Details), and [licenses](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_integrated_license_agent) in your project to learn more about the vulnerabilities in your code.

You can click on an issue to view reliable and actionable insights, including vulnerable methods, fix recommendations, and dependency graphs. You can also filter and customize your view to prioritize the most important issues.

Share scan results with developers by [exporting data to a CSV file](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_sca_export_results). You can also create [Jira Legacy](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Atlassian_Jira_Legacy_Integration_for_Veracode_SCA) and [GitHub](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Creating_and_Fixing_Veracode_SCA_GitHub_Issues) issues directly in the application.
