The Veracode Vulnerability Database contains all the public CVEs and exclusive vulnerability content that is not available elsewhere. The majority of vulnerabilities added to the Veracode Vulnerability Database are exclusive to Veracode, not CVEs.

The security researchers at Veracode are constantly discovering new vulnerabilities in open-source libraries.

You can search the [vulnerability database](https://sca.veracode.com/vulnerability-database/search), and every time you view a vulnerability in Veracode SCA, you can click the vulnerability to learn more about it.
