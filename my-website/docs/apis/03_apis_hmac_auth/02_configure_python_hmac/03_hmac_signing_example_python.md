Veracode provides a Python library you can use to enable HMAC signing within your application. By default, the Python authentication library assumes you store your API credentials in an [API credentials file](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_configure_api_cred_file) or that you pass the credentials with [environment variables](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_store_creds_linux_env). Veracode highly recommends you use an API credentials file.
