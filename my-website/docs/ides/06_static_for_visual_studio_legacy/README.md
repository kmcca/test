Veracode Static for Visual Studio is an extension for Microsoft Visual Studio. You use the extension to assist with compiling your applications into binaries, uploading the binaries to Veracode for static analysis, and review scan results from within the IDE. You must upload any JavaScript code separately, as described in the [compilation instructions](https://docs.veracode.com/r/compilation_jscript).
