You can install Visual Studio 2015 and later in a custom path. You need to add the custom path to MSBuild, based on the listed path patterns. A custom path follows the same patterns shown here, starting after the `\Program Files (x86)` directory.

- `C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\Bin\`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\Bin\amd64\`
