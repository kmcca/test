Before checking in your code, you can start a scan, review security findings and triage the results, all from within your IDE.

<p style="background-color:#FFFCF3; padding: 12px; border-left: 5px solid #F7CD55;"><b>Note:</b> Veracode APIs and integrations require access to <code>analysiscenter.veracode.com</code> and <code>api.veracode.com</code>. Contact your IT team to ensure these domains are on the allowlist for your organization and that there is one-way communication on port 443 to <code>api.veracode.com</code>. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.veracode.com/r/IP_addresses">complete list of domains and IP addresses to add to your allowlist</a>. Also, ensure you access the APIs with the <a href="https://docs.veracode.com/r/Region_Domains_for_Veracode_APIs">domain for your region</a>.</p>

Veracode integrates with these IDEs:

-   [Eclipse](https://docs.veracode.com/r/api_eclipse)
-   [IntelliJ and Android Studio](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_technical_requirements_intellij)
-   [Visual Studio (New)](https://docs.veracode.com/r/About_Veracode_Static_for_Visual_Studio_New)

You can also [Install the Veracode Mobile Application Packager](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_install_xcode) for compiling and packaging iOS applications developed in the Xcode IDE. You can use the Veracode Platform to upload the packaged application for analysis.
