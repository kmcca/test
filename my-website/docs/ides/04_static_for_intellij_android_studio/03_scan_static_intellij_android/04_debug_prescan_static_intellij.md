You can debug prescan files if your uploaded files are in error status.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  In your IDE, close the Prescan Verification Results window or click **No** at the bottom of the window.

2.  Go back to **Veracode** \> **Upload and Scan**.

3.  If necessary, delete problematic binary files that you have previously uploaded, re-upload properly compiled binary files, or upload missing dependencies.

4.  Click **Begin Prescan** in the top-right of the window.

    The prescan completes.

5.  Start the full scan by clicking **Yes** at the bottom of the window.
