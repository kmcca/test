You can create a sandbox into which you upload your application files from your IDE. You can then scan your application from the sandbox.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1. In your IDE, select **Veracode** \> **Upload and Scan**.

2. If prompted, enter your [Veracode API credentials](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_api_credentials3). Select **Store username and password** so that you only have to enter your credentials one time.

3. From the Application dropdown menu, select an application.

4. In the Scan Type field, select **Sandbox Scan**.

5. Click **Create Sandbox** and enter a name for the sandbox.

6. In the Workspace Files table, click the browse icon ![](../../images/browse_icon.png) to select the files to upload from your current projects. Click **Add** to select any files not associated with a current project.

7. Click **Upload** and, then, click **Yes** to confirm that you want to proceed with the upload.

8. Click **Yes** to go directly to the Veracode prescan process after the upload completes. If you do not want the full scan to continue automatically, click **No**. 
9. Click **Begin Prescan** at the top of the Upload Files table.

10. After the prescan completes, click **View Prescan Results** to review the results.
