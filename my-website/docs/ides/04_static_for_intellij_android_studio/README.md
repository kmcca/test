Veracode Static for IntelliJ is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio that enables you to upload binaries to Veracode for static analysis. You can work with the scan results from within your IDE to review and mitigate security findings in your applications.

Veracode also offers [Veracode Greenlight for IntelliJ](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_technical_requirements_intellij), which scans your code and provides instant detection of security findings from within IntelliJ or Android Studio. Instant detection discovers issues earlier so that you can address them quickly and frequently.
