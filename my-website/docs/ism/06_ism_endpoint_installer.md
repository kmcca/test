Veracode recommends you use the ISM endpoint installer to install endpoints on Windows or Linux servers instead of performing a manual installation.

If you are logged in to the Veracode Platform, you can download the installer for both platforms here:

-   [Windows endpoint installer](https://ui.analysiscenter.veracode.com/mvsa/admin/installer/windows)
-   [Linux endpoint installer](https://ui.analysiscenter.veracode.com/mvsa/admin/installer/linux)

The endpoint installer simplifies the process of deploying endpoints and creates a service that runs the endpoint continuously until you stop it.
