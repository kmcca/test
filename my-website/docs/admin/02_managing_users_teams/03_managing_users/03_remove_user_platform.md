There are two ways to remove user access from the system. You can temporarily deactivate the user using the Login Enabled field, or you can permanently delete a user from the Veracode Platform.

<b>Note:</b> Removing a user who has not taken any eLearning courses returns their eLearning seat to the license pool. Removing a user who has already consumed eLearning courses or assessments does not affect their eLearning seat.

You can also remove a user with the [Veracode Identity APIs](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_identity_delete).

<b>Note:</b> You cannot undo the action of deleting a user. If you want to temporarily deactivate the user, select <b>No</b> in the Login Enabled field and, then, click <b>Save</b>.
