Users can have their passwords reset by requesting a password reset at the Veracode Platform log in screen, or by having an Administrator issue a password reset email.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

- You must have the Administrator [role](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions) to reset the password of another user.

- Verify the identity and email address of the user before issuing a password reset.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  In the **Users** tab on the Administration page, select the user you want to manage.

2.  Verify the email address of the user.

    If you need to change the email address, save your changes before clicking the password reset link.

3.  Click **Send a Change Password Email**.

4.  Click **Ok**.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Results</b></p>

The user receives an email containing a special link to allow them to reset their password. The link expires one hour after Veracode sends the email.
