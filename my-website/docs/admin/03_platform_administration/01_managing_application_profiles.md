The application profile describes your application, identifies the policy to evaluate the application with, and provides metadata that enables a thorough analysis of security performance across all the applications in your organization.

You can also manage application profiles with the [Applications REST API](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_apps_intro).

To access the Applications page, click **All Applications** on the Veracode Platform homepage.

From the Applications page, you can:

-   [Add an application](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_add_application) to the portfolio.
-   [Bulk-add several applications at one time](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_bulk_add_applications) to the portfolio.
-   [Edit an existing application profile](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_edit_application_profile).
-   [Delete an existing application profile](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_delete_application).

You must have the appropriate [roles](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_role_permissions) to perform the application profile tasks.
