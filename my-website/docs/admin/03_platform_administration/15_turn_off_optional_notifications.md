You can turn off notifications for all users in your organization to limit the number of Veracode emails they receive. You cannot undo this action at the organization level.

After you turn off all optional notifications, individual users can turn them back on for their [user accounts](https://docs.veracode.com/r/c_about_veracode_accounts).
