If a campaign is set to competition mode, Security Labs users compete against each other on a separate leaderboard for that campaign. You can set up Competition leaderboards on an individual basis or as team-versus-team, where teams are based on the assigned Security Labs user roles.

In competition mode, a campaign has its own leaderboard and countdown timer. The leaderboard displays scores in one of two ways:

-   If you choose **Compete by User**, the leaderboard shows scores by individual user.
-   If you choose **Compete by Role**, the leaderboard shows scores by team.
