Display type determines how the lab interface displays to a user in a Security Labs lesson. These are the display types and how they change lab interfaces:

  | Display Type | Lab Interface Change |
  | --- | --- |
  | **site** | Shows the terminal, GUI editor, the web application of the lab in an iframe, and automatically boots the web application. |
  | **site (no iframe)** | Automatically boots the application of the lab, but does not show an iframe. Your user must click the URL to open the application in a new tab. |
  | **terminal** | Shows only the terminal interface and the GUI file editor. This is good for topics that are not application security; for example, a forensics lab. |
  | **terminal (no editor)** | Shows only the terminal, but not the file editor. This is good for topics that are not application security and do not involve modifying files. |
  | **external** | This is CTF-style (Capture the flag). It shows no terminal or application interface, and only shows an input box. This is good for open-research-type labs or quizzes. |
