You can create custom user roles to group users by a distinct category, such as job function, software language, department, or project. You can then report on users by groups.

You must be a Security Labs administrator to create [Security Labs user roles](https://docs.veracode.com/r/Security_Labs_Roles_and_Permissions).

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Steps</b></p>

1.  Click your username in the top-right corner of the Security Labs page to open the menu.

2.  Select **Assign Roles**.

3.  At the top of the Edit user roles page, enter the new role name.

4.  Click **Make role visible to users** if you want the role to appear separately on its own leaderboard. Otherwise, the role is only visible to administrators.

5.  Click **Add to default roles** if you want to automatically assign this role to every new user.

6.  Click **Create new role**.

    The new role appears in the list of current roles.
