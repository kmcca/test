Security Labs has these roles by default:

- **Standalone Administrator**: The administrator with the most permissions. This user is the primary administrator of your organization if you did not integrate your account with the Veracode Platform.

- **Veracode Platform Integrated Administrator**: Security Labs automatically creates and assigns this default role to users who are administrators in the Veracode Platform. This user can perform many of the same actions as the Standalone Administrator except editing users and modules.

- **Manager**: Can perform most actions that the Administrator can perform, but only for the users they manage.

- **User**: The regular users of your teams for which you can [create and assign custom roles](https://docs.veracode.com/r/t_create_seclabs_roles).
