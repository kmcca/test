As the administrator, you are the contact person in your organization for all Security Labs questions and information. Veracode creates the first Security Labs user account for your organization. You use this account as the Security Labs administrator.

Veracode sends you an email invitation to log in to Security Labs and create your password. After setting up your administrator account, you can configure your SAML gateway and create other users. You can give administrator permissions to any user.
