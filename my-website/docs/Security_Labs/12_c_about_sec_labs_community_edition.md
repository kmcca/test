Veracode Security Labs Community Edition is a free, lightweight version of Security Labs designed for individuals.

While the Enterprise Edition of Veracode Security Labs is geared toward professional development teams, the [Community Edition](https://www.veracode.com/blog/secure-development/announcing-veracode-security-labs-community-edition) offers selected topics and one-off labs for individuals who are looking to strengthen their security knowledge. The Community Edition is intended to help individuals to improve their secure coding skills. It lets you work with real applications, applying the latest tactics and security best practices with guidance, while exploring actual code on your own time.

To use the Community Edition, create an account for yourself at [https://securitylabs-ce.veracode.com/signup](https://securitylabs-ce.veracode.com/). Then, use the verification email you receive from Veracode to activate it.
