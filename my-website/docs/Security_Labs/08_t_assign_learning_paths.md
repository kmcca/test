You must be a Security Labs administrator or manager to assign learning paths.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

An assignment is a grouping of related labs within a campaign. You can configure a Security Labs campaign so that, when a user has completed all of the required labs for an assignment, Security Labs automatically launches the first lab in the next assignment in the campaign.

1.  Click your username in the top-right of the Security Labs page to open the menu.

2.  Select **Assign Content**.

3.  Scroll down to the campaign that you want to modify.

4.  In the Continuous schedule field, set the switch to **Continuous Schedule On** if you want the campaign to automatically forward a user from a completed assignment to the first lab in the next assignment.
