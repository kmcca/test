You can allow a lab to omit steps that users are unable to complete.

<p style="background-color:#FFFCF3; padding: 12px; border-left: 5px solid #F7CD55;">
<b>Note:</b> This feature currently applies to Java OWASP labs only.</p>

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Before You Begin</b></p>

You must be a Security Labs administrator to enable omitting steps.

<p font-size="13pt"><b>Overview</b></p>

By default, Security Labs does not allow you to complete a lab unless you successfully complete every step. However, an administrator may enable this option. When this option is enabled, after several unsuccessful attempts, Security Labs displays a **Skip** button and shows you an example solution. Click **Skip** to move to the next step.

You do not receive points for completing a lab that has omitted one or more steps. To earn these points, you must repeat the lab from the beginning.

2.  Select **Account Settings**.

    The General settings page opens.

3.  To enable the option to omit steps, click **Enable Omitting Steps**.
